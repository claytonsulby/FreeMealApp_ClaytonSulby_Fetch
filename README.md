# Hello Fetch

Thank you for providing me with this coding challenge. Please find brief documentation on how to navigate the application.

## Meals
Upon opening the application, you will find yourself on the "Dessert" meals list. You can sort the list by tapping in the top right "Name ^" menu button and changing "Ascending" to "Descending" or tapping "Id" instead of "Name"

## Details
Tapping any meal in the list will navigate to details about that meal including the instructions and ingredients, as well as the name and the thumbnail for the meal

## Categories
You may also notice that there is a back navigation in the top left "< Categories". Tapping this will bring you to all of the meal categories for you to navigate to as well.
